# FFCR-Model

F-on-F Regression Models with Nonlinear Dynamic Effect and Linear Concurrent Effects

main.R: main function to get the estimation $\beta$ and $\gamma$ in our model. The r file also include the close form solution and FFLR used in simualtion.

Simulation.R : simulate one and two in our model

Real_data1.R : real data analysis one

Real_data2.R : real data analysis two
